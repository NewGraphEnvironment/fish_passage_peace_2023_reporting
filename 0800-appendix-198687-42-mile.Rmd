## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 23km south of the 
community of McLeod Lake. This site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, approximately 
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the 
Crooked River.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` 
order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of 
the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m 
at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198687)). Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` 
have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs].

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198687). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
backwatered and embedded - ranking as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` - according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198687)).  Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

<br>

Although the crossing appeared to be passable at the time of assessment it was noted that recent work had been 
completed to dredge out the stream channel upstream and downstream of the highway. This indicated that the structure
currently in place was not appropriate for the site and that replacement of the crossing could be beneficial from a 
highway maintenance perspective as well as for reducing impacts on the potentially higher value habitat located
immediately adjacent to the road (extensive gravels suitable for spawning). For this reason, a habitat confirmation 
assessment was completed to gatehr data on the value of the habitat upstream and downstream of the crossing.

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Throughout the area surveyed there were signs of beaver activity and patches of 
gravel present suitable for rainbow trout spawning. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198687-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198687-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198687-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` Survey notes indicate patches of gravel suitable for rainbow trout spawning,
few deep pools suitable for overwintering and generallly moderate flow volume. Fry were spotted near culvert and ~450m upstream
of the highway. It was noted that the stream flowed subsurface at a point approximately 550m upstream of culvert. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important migration corridor containing suitable rearing and spawning habitat.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning.

Although the crossing appeared to be passable at the time of assessment it was noted that recent work had been 
completed to dredge out the stream channel upstream and downstream of the highway. This indicated that the structure
currently in place was not appropriate for the site and that replacement of the crossing could be beneficial from a 
highway maintenance perspective as well as for reducing impacts on the potentially higher value habitat located
immediately adjacent to the road (extensive gravels suitable for spawning). For this reason, a habitat confirmation 
assessment was completed to gatehr data on the value of the habitat upstream and downstream of the crossing.

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. The project team
plans to follow up with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to discuss the potential for replacement of the
structure and to provide the necessary data to support the replacement if it is deemed helpful.
