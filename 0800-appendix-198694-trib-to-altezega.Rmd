## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)`
is located on a small spur road and crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(sit  = my_site2, col_pull =road_name)`.  
The crossings are approximately 110m apart. The subject stream is just north of the Kerry Lake East 9 First Nation reserve.

<br>

The subject stream flows into Altezega Creek approximately 300m downstream of the lower crossing (PSCIS `r my_site`).
Altezega Creek in turn flows into the Crooked River approximately 600m downstream of this confluence.  A culvert
crossing is present on the mainstem of Altezega Creek where crossed by the Hart Highway (PSCIS crossing 198664 located
430m upstream from the Crooked River) and was also inventoried as part of the 2023 field assessments.

## Background {.unnumbered}

Upstream of the crossings `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp(sit = my_site2)` have previously been recorded while within Altezega
Creek - `r `fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp(sit = 198664)` have been recorded upstream of the highway crossing with burbot
captured near the highway in 2008 [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs].

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for crossing (`r my_site2`) are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198694). The potential gains for `r my_site` can be assumed to be an additional 
110m. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded and 75% backwatered.  Although ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to 
the provincial protocol [@moe2011] the crossing is considered likely passable to all species and life stages at most flows due to the backwatering and a lack of an outlet drop (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198723)). 

<br>

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was
un-embedded and not backwatered.  Although ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011] the crossing is considered potentially passable to most species and life stages at moderate to low flows due a lack of an outlet drop (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198666)).

Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "us", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r my_site` {.unnumbered}
The stream was assessed downstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` for a distance of ~50m. Although
mapped in the freshwater atlas as crossing `r fpr_my_pscis_info(sit  = my_site2, col_pull =road_name)`, before flowing into Altezega Creek, the mapping is incorrect as the stream flows directly into Altezega Creek approximately 300m downstream.  



## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r my_site` and downstream of `r my_site2`{.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing  `r my_site` for 110m to the location of `r my_site2`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198694-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198694-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198694-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` Abundant gravels suitable for salmonid spawning were noted as present within the area surveyed. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value for
salmonid rearing.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r my_site2` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2,loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198694-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198694-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198694-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` Small fish were spotted periodically throughout survey and 
significant blowdown created large woody debris cover  - particularly for the first 250. Some deep pools suitable for overwintering were noted along with pockets of gravel suitable for spawning. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for rearing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

As the purpose for the section of road on which `r my_site` is located is unclear (small section of road that begins 
on the transmission line but loops back to the FSR), deactivation of the road could be considered.  If the 
road is necessary, an estimate of the cost for replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`. 

<br>

Replacement of crossing `r my_site2` on  `r fpr_my_pscis_info(sit  = my_site2, col_pull =road_name)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is estimated to cost \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2, col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2, col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement as the crossing at the time of the survey had no outlet drop and was 75% backwatered. Crossing 
`r my_site2` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(sit  = my_site2, col_pull =road_name)` ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition and density which may justify a higher or lower priority for site remediation.
