## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`.
PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a small private campground road immediately adjacent to the high
water mark of McLeod Lake and PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located approximately 150m upstream from
McLeod Lake under `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. The stream is situated between McLeod Lake Store and Carp
Lake Road which accesses Tse'Khene food and fuel and the residential community of McLeod Lake on the McLeod Lake 1 First
Nation Reserve.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}
At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` 
order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(site = my_site2)`km^2^. 
The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(site = my_site2, col = 'elev_max')`m to 
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(site = my_site2, col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198666)). Upstream of 
the highway, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for the highway crossing are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198666). Modelling information for culvert under the campground road crossing can be assumed to be an
addition 120m for potential habitat with a calculated remediation gain of 120m.  be A map of the watershed is provided
in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip",
archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, located within the campground was un-embedded, 
non-backwatered and had a culvert slope estimated at 5%.  Although the crossing ranked as a 
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to 
the @moe2011 provincial protocol, juvenile (>100mm) and adult salmonids are likely able to migrate through the short pipe 
length (5m) with no outlet drop (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198714)). 

<br>

A deep outlet pool (1m) and a large outlet drop (0.7m) at the Highway 97 crossing (PSCIS `r as.character(my_site2)`) was
an indication that the culvert is undersized for the amount of discharge in the watershed.  The large outlet drop (0.7m)
and extensive length (60m) of the structure likely block upstream migration for all fish life stages and species at all
flows. The unembedded and non-backwaered culvert ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to @moe2011
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198666)).

<br>


Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "us", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "us", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "us", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-d01))."))`
In the area surveyed, the stream was noted as having good flow and abundant 
gravels suitable for rainbow trout spawning. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as 
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value with habitat present suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` beginning at a point accessed approximately 275m upstream of the highway
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`  It was noted that there were no gravels observed in the area 
surveyed within the shallow fine substrate channels connecting numerous beaver dams within a wetland type area.  The habitat 
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` value with some very deep pool areas upstream
of beaver dams.

<br>

The stream was also assessed at the location of crossing 198710 located approximately 1..7km upsteam of the highway.  Crossing 198710 was found to be a washed out bridge. 
To help build an understanding of fish habitat values upstream of the highway crossing the stream was also surveyed
at this location for a distance of 200m within a large beaver influenced wetland area containing turbid water.  Numerous
beaver dams were observed.  No gravels were noted  
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us3')` The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us3')` value containing habitat suitable for rearing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

It is recommended that if `r as.character(my_site)` is not essential for vehicle traffic that the small structure
be replaced with a walking bridge or removed completely.  If either of those options are not suitable, replacement of
the crossing with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is estimated to cost \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.  The culvert under the highway
would require extensive works to complete costing an estimated \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Although the culvert at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was not considered a severe barrier to upstream fish
passage due to its short length and lack of outlet drop, the structure is likely undersized for the amount of discharge
in the watershed. The straight and uniform channel in the areas adjacent to the lake indicate that historically the
stream channel may have been dredged to confine the stream to a define channel to facilitate culvert installation and
reduce maintenance. The location of this crossing within the campground and immediately adjacent to the community of
McLeod Lake may present opportunities for not only the removal or replacement of the current structure but also
potentially restoration of the stream channel and habitat adjacent to the lake.

<br>

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of the Highway 97 crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with
areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing with fine substrates and some habitat fragmentation due to subsurface/shallow flows within the heavily 
beaver influenced wetland type areas upstream. The large outlet drop and extensive length of the structure likely present
a complete barrier to all fish species and life stages.  The highway crossing (PSCIS `r as.character(my_site2)`) was 
priliminarily ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to 
design for replacement but electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into 
fish community composition and density which may justify a higher priority for site remediation. It is also recommended
that the the local McLeod Lake community be consulted to scope for information about the site and determine the importance 
of the stream to the community.
