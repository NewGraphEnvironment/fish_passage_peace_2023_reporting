## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. This site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, approximately 150m
upstream from McLeod Lake. The stream crossing is located between McLeod Lake Store and the Tse'Khene food and fuel entrance.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2022].
<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198666). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198666)). There
was high flow through the culvert at the time of survey. A deep
outlet pool (2m) and a large outlet drop (2m) indicate that the
culvert may be undersized. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was an abundance of large woody debris that created deep pools, diverted water flow, and created natural steps. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198666-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` This stream has the potential to be fish bearing but the gradient is steep. The bank full depth is very high, with a measured average of 0.8m. There was an abundance of large woody debris that provided functionality to the stream habitat by diverting flow and providing cover. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable rearing habitat.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community
composition and density which may justify a higher priority for site remediation.
