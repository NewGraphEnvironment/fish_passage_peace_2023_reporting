Abundant LWD and overhanging vegetation over stream. Numerous beaver dams found, spanning channel. Water is very turbid in wetland. Good flowing stream after wetland. Dams could present barrier to fish. Overall moderate habitat value. 13:25:08"

Stream substrate is mostly mud, creating high turbidity. Abundant large woody debris in channel affecting flow. Wide channel with moderate flow. Thick, mature riparian vegetation creating cover. Overall moderate habitat value. 14:10:28"
15,42 Mile Creek,198687_us,198687,us,,2023-09-01,9:23:38,MW,600,,,3940,RB,Medium habitat value. Few patches of gravel suitable for rainbow spawning. Very little deep pools suitable for overwintering. Moderate flow with some undercut banks and functional large woody debris. No cascades or steep drops that could be barriers. Small fry spotted near culvert and ~450m upstream. Stream dewaters 550m upstream of culvert. Sporadic areas with water afterwards. Healthy deciduous riparian vegetation.  09:23:38
16,42 Mile Creek,198687_ds,198687,ds,,2023-09-01,10:50:07,MW,200,,,,,Medium habitat value. Channel becomes significantly smaller 200m downstream and dewaters. Signs of beaver activity. Abundant overhanging vegetation providing suitable cover. Some patches of gravel present suitable for rainbow spawners. A few deep pools.  10:50:07

A lot of blowndown first 250m, creating cover across channel and adding complexity to stream habitat. Some deep pools suitable for overwintering. A couple areas with patches of gravel for spawning. No major barriers present. Low gradient stream with riffle pool morphology, no steps or cascades. Overall, habitat rated high value.  09:47:34"

19,Tributary to McLeod Lake,198666_us,198666,us,,2023-08-31,13:33:57,AI MD,220,,,4680,RB,Beaver influenced wetland area upstream for entire length. Some flowing sections for the bottom 75 m or so but no gravels or well defined deep pools present. Repair of the culvert would not likely result in fish use upstream due to lack of flowing water and potential freezing during winter       13:33:57
