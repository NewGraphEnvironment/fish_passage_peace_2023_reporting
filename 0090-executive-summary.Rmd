# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs.

<br>

The Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC (SERNbc) is working together with the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), road/rail tenure holders and other FWCP stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan and fund the restoration of fish passage at road crossing structure barriers within the Parsnip River, Carp River and Crooked River watershed groups.

<br>

The project engages FWCP partners and stakeholders to clearly communicate fish passage issues in FWCP Peace Region watersheds while collaboratively planning and executing the steps necessary to realize fish passage restorations. Work completed and ongoing aligns with the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program Rivers, Lakes and Reservoirs Action Plan [@fishandwildlifecompensationprogram2020PeaceRegion] sub objective 6 of addressing fish passage issues in streams to enhance productivity of priority species. Project activities undertaken address the following actions:

-   PEA.RLR.S06.RI.20 - Conducting engagement to prioritize options for fish passage improvement-P1
-   PEA.RLR.S06.RI.19 - Conducting research to prioritize fish passage actions-P1
-   PEA.RLR.S06.HB.21 - Restoring fish access to streams-P1

This project builds on Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) work in [2019 - 2020](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/) [@irvine2020ParsnipRiver], [2021 - 2022](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_parsnip_2021_reporting/)[@irvine2022PEAF22F3577DCARestoring] and [2022 - 2023](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/) [@irvine_winterscheidt2023RestoringFish].

Through 2023/2024 project activities numerous project partners were engaged and we were able to identify and conduct fish passage planning/restoration activities at multiple high priority sites.

-   In 2020-2022, we collaborated with McLeod Lake and Sinclar to replace crossing 125179 with a bridge. Partnership funding covered 75% of the costs. The site was visited in 2022, and data, along with orthoimagery acquired by drone, is available online.

-   BCTS leveraged our prioritization of crossing 125345, located on a tributary to the Parsnip River, to help them secure funding for its removal during the 2023 deactivation of the Chuchinka-Colbourne FSR.

-   BCTS leveraged our prioritization of crossing 125403 (tributary to the Parsnip River) to help them secure funding to remove the crossing during deactivation of the Hooda Lake Forest Service Road in 2023.

-   In 2023, Canfor plans to replace crossing 125231 (Tributary to Table River) at km21 on the Chuchinka-Table FSR with a bridge. An engineering design is complete, materials sourced, and a contract with Canfor is in place for installation preparations (engineering design, environmental management planning/permitting, and material acquisition). The estimated replacement cost is \$410,000, and Canfor committed \$205,000. To proceed in 2024, FWCP support is necessary to cover the remaining 50% (\$90,000) of project costs.

-   We are building McLeod Lake's capacity to engage in fisheries management and restoration activities within their territory through training, fieldwork, and inclusion in planning and communication processes.

-   To diversify potential partners for implementation and funding, remediation planning and fieldwork were conducted at various sites in the Carp River, Crooked River, and Parsnip River watershed groups. This included initial surveys on numerous Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure sites, incorporating recently adapted assessments with climate change risk assessment metrics

<br>

In addition to structure replacements and removals to restore connectivity - communications, research and monitoring are essential parts of any restoration initiative as they ensure that we identify the best and most efficient opportunities for fish passage restoration while incorporating adaptive management informed by traditional knowledge and real-time planning/monitoring data. Recommendations going forward include:

-   Continue to engage partners to raise funds for remediations, identify sites for restoration, conduct remedial works and assess effectiveness of works.
-   Continue to conduct detailed assessments where blockages are present and large amounts of habitat are potentially available within the Parsnip River and neighboring watershed groups. As timelines for remediations can be extensive, planning onerous and costs of remedial works significant, continuing assessments throughout the greater area will provide more options for remediation and engage additional funding partners (ex. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, alternative forest licensees). Identifying areas of concern near the community of McLeod Lake is expected to further engage community members and most effectively promote restoration activities.
-   Conduct effectiveness monitoring where sites have been remediated, where sites have been prioritized and where remediations are planned. Electrofishing surveys including tagging of target species with PIT tags are recommended to understand the extent of connectivity impairments, track fish movement/health over time and inform adaptive management. Detailed habitat assessments and acquisition of temperature data can be considered along with photo documentation of stream morphology near crossings.
